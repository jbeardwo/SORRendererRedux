# SORRendererRedux

This is a revamped version of an ongoing webGL project for CS160 (Graphics) at UCSC.
I really liked this project so I'm going back and creating a cleaner, more efficient, user friendly version.

This program takes in a user drawn line and uses it as the profile for a vase-like object by rotating it around the z-axis.
This will eventually have various camera and lighting options as well. Adding features as I go.
